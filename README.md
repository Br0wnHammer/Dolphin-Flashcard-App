# Flashcard-App
## Broad Overview
A broad overview of the plans for the language learning app

## USPs and Points of Differentiation
* Flashcard app with nice UI
* Spaced Repetition
* Gamified with lots of "juice"

Anki solely fills the second point, while Quizlet serves the first point. None fully cover all points. This would provide a unique opportunity for this app 

## Broad Overview
A broad overview of the planned features to be made
### Flashcard System
* Log into account
* Create account
* Users should be able to see a tree list of all the cards they have added. They should be able to see which folders everything is in
* There should be an indicator like Anki showing how many cards are there to learn, recap and revise in each folder and set
* You can click a three dot menu to view all cards in the set, not just the ones you need to learn. You can access the same options as below
* When you click this menu, you can also choose to create a card
* When you click on a card or a folder, you view all the cards you need to learn or revise in it as a list
* Flashcards
* Multiple choice QU
* With each qu, you can see whether you know a little, whether you know it well, or not at all
* Cards have HTML code which can be rendered. Images or text can be uploaded
* Folders can be created or deleted. Cards can be created, deleted or moved around
* Anki-Like Algorithm
* More details to follow

### Gamified Features
* Streak, XP
* Leader board with multiple levels. Completing a level in the top 5 pushes you to the next level
* Quests - things like learn x cards, add x cards, get an x day Streak etc
* When you win them you get a badge on your profile
* When you complete one the variable x increases 
* When you win it again the badge looks the same but it has a different number associated with it - the badge number
* Quests give you gold

### Access Control System
* The user that created the flashcard/folder owns the flashcard/folder. If they own the folder, they own all the cards inside it
* Other users can view it but not edit it
* If they want to edit it, they can first clone it
* Users can find flashcards made by other users on a separate search tab
* Users can be given access to flashcard by the owner
